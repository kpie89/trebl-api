# TreblApi

# Overview
This is a social platform for building community playlists. It was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgrSQL on the back end and Ember on the front end.

The general idea of the project is that a user can sign up and in to Trebl and see a list of playlists made by other users. A user can also 'comment' on this playlist, thereby adding their mark on the playlist based in the original posters song choice. In future iterations, users will be able to 'friend' each other and create social playlists just amongst select groups of friends.
